# ANALYSIS

Where the numbers come from. Nothing here is a preference; each figure is
derived, and `cargo xtask check-model` re-derives it.

## The accumulator widths

`MAX_K_BITS = 64` is **declared**, not probed. The alternative --- deriving it
from `usize::BITS / size_of::<E>()` on the host --- gives a *narrower* bound
(79 / 94 / 125 / 188 rather than 79 / 95 / 127 / 191) and resolves to the same
accumulator type for every element type. Declaring it is still the right choice,
because it makes the table target-independent: `CD-06` and `CA-02` then compare
one function against itself rather than two functions that happen to agree.

The complex rows carry one extra bit, for the two element-products the real part
sums. `log2(PRODUCT_TERMS)` is read from the element type, so a complex alphabet
needs no separate table and no branch.

## The complete accumulator widths

For `f32`: the minimum subnormal is `2^-149`, so the minimum product exponent is
`2 * -149 = -298`. The maximum finite value is below `2^128`, so the maximum
product exponent is `256`. The span is `256 - (-298) = 554` bits. Add
`MAX_K_BITS = 64` for the depth and one for the sign: `619`, which is 10 limbs
of 64 bits, 80 bytes.

For `f64`: `2 * -1074 = -2148` and `2 * 1024 = 2048`, a span of `4196`; plus 64
plus 1 is `4261`, which is 67 limbs, 536 bytes.

The 536 bytes per output element is the real cost of exactness at `f64`, and it
is not hidden: a large register-blocked tile is expensive on a small target. The
mitigation is a traversal choice, not a method choice.

## The narrow-register thresholds

Each is `floor(cap / per_step)`, where `per_step` is the worst-case magnitude
one step of that instruction sequence contributes.

| Sequence | per step | cap | threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| plain `i32` tile, W8A8 | `127 * 127 = 16129` | `i32::MAX` | 133144 |
| `vpdpbusd` offset, W8A8 | `255 * 127 = 32385` | `i32::MAX` | 66311 |
| `vpdpbusd` compensation | `128 * 127 = 16256` | `i32::MAX` | 132104 |
| `_mm256_madd_epi16` pair | `2 * 127 * 127 = 32258` | `i32::MAX` | 66572 steps |
| `vmull_s8` in `i16` | `127 * 127 = 16129` | `i16::MAX` | 2 |

The last row is why the NEON kernel widens to `i32` immediately: three `i16`
products do not fit (`3 * 127^2 = 48387 > i16::MAX`), so accumulating even two
of them in `i16` would be a saturation waiting to happen.

None of these is a limit. A tile past its threshold takes a wider lane and
computes the same integer, and `CU-03` asserts agreement at depths straddling
each one.

## The blocking parameters

`mc = 128`, `kc = 256`, `nc = 1024`. Cache-shaped, explicitly allowlisted out of
R1, and asserted invariant by `CD-01`: changing one cannot change any output
byte, only which traversal produces it. They are the one table in the model that
is *tuning* rather than derivation, and saying so is the point of the allowlist.

## The property-suite sample size

`CP-01` runs 4096 randomized cases per run, at a recorded seed.

The number is derived from what the suite has to catch. A defect confined to one
position of a packed tile survives a random case with probability
`1 - 1/(MR * NR)`. The widest shipped kernel is `8 x 32 = 256` positions, so
after `n` independent cases the escape probability is `(1 - 1/256)^n`. Requiring
that below `10^-6` gives

```text
n >= 256 * ln(10^6) ~= 256 * 13.8 ~= 3538
```

and 4096 is the next power of two above it. The seed is recorded so a failure is
reproducible; a suite whose failures cannot be reproduced is a lottery.

## The corpus shapes

Zero, one, primes, powers of two plus and minus one, and rectangular extremes.
Chosen so that no block size divides anything and every tail path is reached. A
corpus of round numbers would agree with almost any implementation, which is the
failure mode this list exists to avoid --- and it earned its keep immediately, by
finding a `5 x 0` output that the aliasing check reported as self-aliasing
because a row-major view over zero columns has a row stride of zero.

## The scaling fits

Least squares in log-log space, over geometrically spaced points. Geometric
rather than linear because a fit over linearly spaced sizes is dominated by the
largest few and reports the asymptote of the tail rather than of the curve.

Fewer than three points do not fit: two points determine a line exactly and
would report a confidence interval of zero, which would be a lie rather than a
measurement. The reported interval is `1.96` standard errors; with few points
that is optimistic, which is why the sample count is reported beside it.

Every figure is `open`. `CG-01` on a two-core shared runner measured an exponent
of about `0.98 +/- 0.06` against MAC count, which is what an `O(m k n)`
implementation should give --- reported, not asserted.

## Where the time goes

Measured on a two-core shared runner with AVX2 and no AVX-512. Every figure is
`open`. What follows is what measuring found, in the order it was found, because
every one of them was a copy or a traversal rather than arithmetic --- and none
of them was visible by reading.

**The accumulator was passed by value.** `Element::mac` took and returned
`Self::Acc`. For an `i128` that is free; for `Complete<10>` it is 88 bytes in
and 88 bytes out, *twice* per product once `add_scaled` did the same. Making
both take `&mut` was worth 4x on `f32` and 1.6x on the packed integer path,
because the integer kernels were paying for it too through the shared trait.

**The complete accumulator added at full width.** `add_scaled` built a
full-width value and combined it, which is O(L) per product --- 67 limbs for
`f64`. Adding the three spread limbs in place, with a carry that stops as soon
as a limb absorbs it, makes it O(1) in the common case. `Limbs::add_i128` had
the same shape and got the same fix.

**Coded random access walked the row.** `CodedMatrix::at` found row `r` by
walking every preceding row's codes. That is O(row) per element, which makes a
driver reading one element at a time O(k^2 n) rather than O(m k n) --- not a
constant factor, a different curve. It showed up as a benchmark that did not
finish. Fixed-width tiers now index by arithmetic; only a run codec walks, and
only when a caller uses random access on one.

**The packing loop indexed instead of walking.** `origin + i * rs + j * cs` per
element is two multiplies where a walk is one add, and the panel is a million
elements. `MatView::row_walk` and `column_walk`, with the full panel split from
the edge, was worth 1.7x on `i32`.

**Panels were packed at microkernel granularity.** A panel is `mr` rows or `nr`
columns wide, and packing at that granularity repacks `A` once per column
*panel*: `m*n*k/nr` element copies against `m*n*k` of arithmetic. At the shipped
`nr` that is not a rounding error --- it was the same order as the arithmetic,
and it was the whole distance between this driver and the instruction ceiling of
its own kernels. Packing in cache-shaped *blocks* instead was worth 2.1x on `i8`
and 2.3x on `i32`.

**`k_group` was declared and ignored.** Every SIMD kernel rebuilt its `k`-group
in a stack buffer once per step, because the packed layout did not group. Making
the layout honour it --- `k`-major in groups, lane-major within one --- lets
`B`'s group widen straight into the vectors `madd`, `dpwssd`, `sdot` and `dot`
consume, and `A`'s group be one unaligned load and a broadcast. It also removed
every kernel's `k`-tail. Worth 1.35x on `i8`.

**The block extents read the blocking as a column count.** `NC` columns of `B`
at a panel depth of the whole `k` is a `k/KC`-times-oversized panel, which at
`k = 1024` is the difference between a panel in L2 and a panel in memory. Read
as a working *set* --- `KC * NC` elements of `B`, `MC * KC` of `A` --- the block
narrows as the depth grows and what stays resident stays the same size.

**A narrow output paid for columns that were not there.** A tile kernel produces
`nr` columns per call whether the output has them or not; at `n = 1` that is one
useful lane in ninety-six. The reduce factorization puts the lanes on `k`, where
there is always more. Worth 50x on a matrix-vector product.

**A packed panel is a copy, and some panels were already there.** For a
`LaneLayout::Contiguous` kernel the panel *is* a run of rows or of columns, so a
row-major `A` and a column-major `B` already hold it --- which is not an exotic
case, it is a matrix-vector product with the ordinary layout, where the panel
would otherwise be one element written per multiply-accumulate and double the
whole product's memory traffic. `MatView::row_block` and `column_block` hand back
the operand's own memory when the strides already say so. Worth a further 37x on
a single deep dot product, which then needs no working memory at all.

**The float encode formed the magnitude once per bit.** `magnitude_bit` negated
the whole register on every call: 10 limbs for `f32`, 67 for `f64`, once per
significand bit. That is O(P*L) where O(P + L) does. Forming the magnitude once
and reading a `P`-bit window out of it was worth 2.9x on `f32` at `k = 2`, where
the encode is nearly the whole cost, and nothing at large `k`, where the
accumulate loop is.

What remains, and why:

- `A` is still repacked once per column *block*, which at the suggested offer is
  once. Removing the last of it needs a `C` accumulator panel of exact
  accumulators, which is memory the library is not allowed to own (R7). A caller
  who wants it can partition and reuse.
- The generic and coded drivers walk `k` innermost, so `B` is read with stride
  `n`. Fixing that needs an accumulator row, which is again memory the library
  cannot own. The kernel-driven path is the one that packs.
- `m = 1` against a wide `n` still fills a `6`-row panel with one real row. The
  shape is memory-bound either way --- `B` must be read once for `k*n` products
  --- and the library is ahead of both integer oracles there, so the padding is
  hidden. It is the one shape where a narrower tile panel would still buy
  something.
- `f32` is far slower than the integer paths. The size of that gap is measured
  against the *oracles* below, not against our own integer path, because
  comparing a library to itself says nothing about whether the cost is
  reasonable.

## Against the oracles

C3 is a hard constraint: scaling is compared against the oracle's scaling. Both
sides are measured in one process, over one sweep spanning ten orders of
magnitude in MAC count, with the answer asserted inside the timed region --- a
speed measured on the wrong bytes is not a measurement.

Two-core shared runner with AVX2 and no AVX-512. Best of as many repetitions as
fit a fixed wall-clock budget, so the large end gets more than two samples.
Operands are a recorded pseudo-random fill: they used to be all ones, which
flattered this library twice, because then every `f32` product shares one
exponent and the complete accumulator's limb window never once has to flush.
Every figure is `open`.

### Throughput on squares, Gmac/s

| `n` | uor `i8` | uor `i32` | ndarray `i32` | nalgebra `i32` | uor `f32` exact | matrixmultiply `f32` |

### Throughput on shapes that are not squares, Gmac/s

A square is one use-case and not the interesting one. Each row below stresses a
different half of the driver.

| `m x k x n` | uor `i8` | uor `i32` | ndarray `i32` | nalgebra `i32` | uor `f32` | matrixmultiply `f32` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1024x1024x1 | 34.5 | 16.4 | 3.23 | 0.17 | 0.19 | 2.25 |
| 1x1024x1024 | 0.54 | 0.29 | 0.21 | 0.14 | 0.14 | 1.21 |
| 8x262144x8 | 6.63 | 5.06 | 1.70 | 1.77 | 0.24 | 16.0 |
| 1x1048576x1 | 40.2 | 10.2 | 2.43 | 0.40 | 0.15 | 0.31 |
| 2048x8x2048 | 8.78 | 7.88 | 1.08 | 0.81 | 0.12 | 13.2 |
| 4096x2x4096 | 1.19 | 2.19 | 0.42 | 0.18 | 0.05 | 0.86 |
| 509x1021x257 | 26.3 | 23.2 | 1.22 | 5.47 | 0.24 | 41.7 |

### Latency at the smallest shapes, nanoseconds per call

| `n` | uor `i8` | uor `i32` | ndarray | matrixmultiply |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 140 | 80 | 60 | 80 |
| 4 | 250 | 160 | 130 | 100 |

### Fitted exponent of throughput against MAC count

| | exponent |
| --- | --- |
| uor `i8` | 0.35 |
| uor `i32` | 0.32 |
| ndarray | 0.04 |
| nalgebra | 0.20 |
| uor `f32` | 0.09 |
| matrixmultiply | 0.32 |

A positive exponent means throughput still improving with size: the small end is
latency-dominated for everyone. `ndarray`'s 0.04 is the opposite story --- it
starts fast and *degrades*, from 1.9 Gmac/s at `n = 64` to 0.15 at `n = 2048`,
which is a cache story rather than an arithmetic one. Ours tracks
`matrixmultiply`'s almost exactly, which is what a driver with the same blocking
structure should do.

### What this says

**On integers, this library is ahead of both oracles at every size that is not
latency-bound.** At `n = 512` it is 67x `ndarray` and 7.9x `nalgebra`; at
`n = 1024`, 174x and 8.4x. Nothing about that is a compromise on exactness: the
integer result is the exact sum encoded once, and `CX-01` .. `CX-04` and `CX-10`
assert it byte for byte against four independent implementations, including one
outside the Rust ecosystem.

**On integer squares it is now within 1.2x of `matrixmultiply`'s `f32`.** That
comparison is across element types and is not a like-for-like claim; it is here
because `matrixmultiply` is the fastest thing in the process and it says how much
of the machine the driver is reaching.

**On a matrix-vector product it is 10x ahead of `ndarray` and 15x ahead of
`matrixmultiply`.** That shape used to be this library's worst, at 0.70 Gmac/s,
and the reason was structural: the tile kernel produced sixteen columns for a
product that has one. The reduce factorization and panel borrowing are what
closed it, and both are the same identity, factored differently.

**Latency at `n = 1` is 140 ns against `ndarray`'s 60.** The difference is view
construction and kernel selection, both once per call and neither scaling. It is
one of two places an oracle is ahead, and the sweep says so.

**On floats the library is roughly 180x behind `matrixmultiply`, and that is the
trade N4 names.** A classical `sgemm` issues one fused multiply-add per element.
This one decodes two IEEE bit patterns, multiplies their significands as
integers, and places the exact product into a 619-bit fixed-point register ---
and never rounds until the end. The gap is the price of an answer that does not
depend on the order of the additions, which no figure in the `matrixmultiply`
column has. It is also the honest figure rather than the earlier one: with
all-ones operands the limb window never flushed and the same measurement read
120x.

### The modular factorization

`i32` reaching 27 Gmac/s is not a `wrapping_mul` shortcut. When the caller asks
to encode by wrapping into a `w`-bit output, reduction modulo `2^w` is a ring
homomorphism, so accumulating in `Z/2^w` *is* the exact accumulation seen in the
quotient the caller named. `_mm256_mullo_epi32` then gives eight products per
instruction where the exact `i64` lane gives four, with no widening, because in
the quotient there is nothing to widen to.

Which factorization runs is decided by two *declarations* --- the encode mode
and the output width --- and never by inspecting the data. `CD-05` asserts that
both give the value their mode asks for, and that past `i32` they disagree,
which is what makes the choice observable rather than cosmetic.

### The reduce factorization

A tile kernel's vector lanes are columns of `C`. A reduce kernel's are steps of
`k`. Both compute the same integer, and `CB-06` asserts it; which one runs is
decided by the shape against the tile, which is a declaration the caller made
when they constructed the view.

It needs no second driver. A reduce panel is the *same* layout function at
`group = kpad`, so `packed_slot` reduces to `lane * kpad + p` and one `usize` in
the packer covers both. The table carries a reduce sequence for every family on
every ISA, each at a four-row and a one-row panel, because a panel wider than the
output is zero-padded and for a reduce kernel that padding is copied at `k`
elements a row.

### The declared alphabet

`_mm256_madd_epi16` sums two products into an `i32`, and two full-magnitude
`i16` products are `2 * 2^30` --- one bit past it. So that sequence is exact
exactly while the alphabet bound is at most `32767`, and at the full `i16`
alphabet it returned `-2^31` where the exact sum is `+2^31`. A random fill
reaches that input with probability `2^-64`, which is why the parity tests did
not find it and now ask for the extremes by name.

The fix is a declaration, not a guard: a `KernelSpec` carries `max_bound`, the
widest alphabet its sequence is exact on, and selection does not consider a
sequence outside it. The paired sequence declares `32767` and keeps its
instruction count; a widening sequence declares every `i16` and issues more.
Both are exact on what they declare, which is what makes them two factorizations
rather than a fast one and a safe one --- outside its alphabet the paired
sequence does not compute this identity at all.
