//! The kernel table (§7.1).
//!
//! One signature per element family, identical across ISAs. A [`KernelSpec`] is
//! a value; adding an ISA adds one and touches no driver code.
//!
//! # The two factorizations
//!
//! Both compute the same thing. Neither is a fallback, and neither is a
//! classical method: they are the one identity, factored two ways.
//!
//! [`Factorization::Exact`] accumulates in a lane wide enough that the partial
//! sum cannot leave it, and the lanes fold into `AccOf<E>` --- which cannot
//! overflow at all --- before the single encode step. The lane width is decided
//! from the declared alphabet bound.
//!
//! [`Factorization::Modular`] applies when the caller asks to encode by
//! wrapping into a `w`-bit output. Reduction modulo `2^w` is a ring
//! homomorphism, so reducing the exact sum once at the end equals reducing at
//! every step: accumulating in `Z/2^w` *is* the exact accumulation, seen in the
//! quotient the caller asked for. That is the same fact §3.4 rests on for the
//! integer oracles, and it is what lets a `w`-bit lane carry an unbounded depth
//! with no wide accumulator behind it.
//!
//! Which one runs is decided by the caller's *declarations* --- the alphabet
//! bound and the encode mode --- never by a heuristic and never by the data.
