//! One accumulator per element type, wide enough by construction (§5.3).
//!
//! There is no wrapping model here. A width derived from the element type
//! cannot wrap for any expressible input, so the arithmetic is plain and exact,
//! and `CT-02` checks it by running the whole corpus in a build where every
//! accumulator operation is checked and any overflow panics.
//!
//! Narrow-register tiles still exist and are still the fast path. They are
//! selected by [`crate::bounds::fits_narrow`] per tile, they compute the same
//! integer, and their result is combined into the wide accumulator. That is a
//! factorization, not a fallback: nothing about the answer or the guarantee
//! depends on which side of the predicate a tile lands (R13).

// R5 asks that *wrapping* arithmetic be written explicitly, so that a debug and
// a release binary are the same function. It does not ask that every operation
// be spelled `wrapping_*`: in this module the arithmetic is deliberately plain,
// because a width derived from the element type cannot wrap for any expressible
// input (§3.2, §5.3), and writing `wrapping_add` here would assert the opposite.
//
// The witness that the derivation holds is not a lint but `CT-02`: the whole
// corpus runs under the `checked` profile, where every one of these operations
// is checked and any overflow panics. A lint could only be satisfied by hiding
// the question; the checked build answers it.
