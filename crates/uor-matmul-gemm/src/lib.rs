//! The driver: the operation with a conventional GEMM face on it.
//!
//! [`gemm`] returns `()`. Not `Result<(), _>`, not `Result<(), Infallible>`:
//! `()`. The type signature carries the totality claim, and there is no second
//! place for a condition to arise, because every question a classical GEMM
//! answers with an error --- depth, magnitude, alignment, host capability ---
//! has an answer here for every input (R14, C6, `CT-05`).
//!
//! Non-existence of the requested object is reported once, at view
//! construction, by [`uor_matmul_core::Triple::new`] and [`CodedTriple::new`].
//! Those are the library's only two fallible constructors and they share the
//! same two failures.
//!
//! # One method
//!
//! Everything below is *decode, accumulate exactly, encode once* at a different
//! instantiation. The traversals differ in which order they walk the output and
//! how much working memory they use; they do not differ in what they compute,
//! and `CD-05` asserts it byte for byte.
