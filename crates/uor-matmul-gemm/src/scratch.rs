///
/// The panel buffer is where decoded operands are packed. The *accumulator*
/// buffer is the one that removes a classical constraint, so it deserves saying
/// why it exists.
///
/// A classical GEMM chunks the reduction so that its panels fit cache, and
/// accumulates the chunks into `C` as it goes. It can do that because its
/// accumulator and its output are the same width --- and the price is that the
/// answer depends on the chunking, which is why no two classical `sgemm`
/// implementations agree bit for bit.
///
/// This library cannot write partial sums into `C`, because `C` is the *encoded*
/// output and encoding a partial sum would round it. So without somewhere to keep
/// the exact partial sums, the panels must hold the whole of `k` --- which makes
/// the offer grow with the depth, and a caller with an astronomical `k` either
/// supplies an astronomical buffer or gets the unblocked traversal.
///
/// An accumulator buffer is that somewhere. With one, the reduction is chunked to
/// whatever the cache holds while every partial sum stays exact and full width,
/// and the offer stops growing with `k`. This is the property the exact
/// accumulator buys and a classical library cannot have: the sum is
/// order-independent, so it may be split any way the machine prefers and
/// recombined with no consequence at all.
///
/// Offering one is optional, like every other offer. Offering none gives the same
/// bytes from the full-depth traversal (`CD-04`, `CD-10`).
