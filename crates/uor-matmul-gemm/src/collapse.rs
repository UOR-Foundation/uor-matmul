//! The collapse traversal: charge per distinct meaning, not per expression.
//!
//! Every other traversal in this library issues `m * k * n` products, whatever
//! the operands hold. That is not a property of the identity --- it is a
//! property of how the identity has been walked. Two equal rows of `A` name the
//! same sum against every column of `B`, so a driver that computes both has
//! computed one thing twice.
//!
//! This traversal computes each *distinct* row once. It is the same identity
//! (`R13`): decode the code, accumulate exactly, encode once --- with the
//! accumulation performed once per distinct row rather than once per row.
//! `CD-12` asserts it byte-identical to the packed and streaming traversals at
//! every degeneracy, including none.
//!
//! # Why an exact library may do this and a classical one may not
//!
//! Sharing a result between two rows is sound exactly when the two rows name
//! the same value, and here they do: the sum is over a declared alphabet, taken
//! exactly, with no rounding step between the products and the single encode.
//! A classical `sgemm` sharing a row would also have to argue that its *order*
//! of additions was the same, because its answer depends on that order. This
//! one has nothing to argue: an exact sum is a function of the multiset of
//! products, so equal operands give equal sums by definition rather than by
//! accident.
//!
//! # Columns
//!
//! Sharing is not always on the `A` side. It does not need a second traversal:
//! `(A * B)^T = B^T * A^T`, transposition is a stride, and equal columns of `B`
//! are equal rows of `B^T` --- so collapsing them is this traversal applied to
//! [`Triple::transposed`], with the same pass, the same compaction, and the same
//! expansion. One walks the output's rows and the other its columns, which is
//! the only difference and is entirely a question of the output's strides.
//!
//! # An offer, never a requirement
//!
//! Like [`crate::Scratch`], collapse is memory the caller offers. Offering none
//! runs the packed traversal, and offering too little to hold what the pass
//! finds runs the packed traversal --- the same bytes either way, which is what
//! `CD-12` asserts. This is the one traversal whose selection reads the
//! operand's *content*, and the caller's offer is the invitation to read it: a
//! caller who knows their `A` has no repeated rows offers nothing and pays
//! nothing.
//!
//! # What it costs when it finds nothing
//!
//! One pass over `A`: `m * k` reads against the product's `m * k * n`, so a
//! `1/n` share, and it is charged honestly rather than hidden --- `CG-09`
//! reports the throughput at degeneracy one beside the throughput at the
//! degeneracies it exists for.
