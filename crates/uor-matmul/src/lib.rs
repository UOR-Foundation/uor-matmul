//! Exact matmul on coded operands.
//!
//! > Decode the code, accumulate exactly, encode once.
//!
//! Every entry point in this library is that sentence at a different
//! instantiation. There is no fast path and no careful path, no SIMD kernel and
//! no scalar fallback, and nothing held in reserve for hard cases --- because
//! the exact accumulation has no hard cases.
//!
//! # What it computes
//!
//! For integer operands, the exact value of `sum a_i * d(w_i)`, encoded once
//! into the caller's output type. Byte-identical to any external integer GEMM
//! wherever that library is also exact --- and where it is not, the difference
//! is *its* error, which this library is positioned to measure (§3.4).
//!
//! # What it never does
//!
//! - Allocate. There is no `alloc` dependency in any shipped crate. Working
//!   memory is offered by the caller, and offering none is a supported choice.
//! - Fail. [`gemm`] returns `()`. The only reportable condition in the whole
//!   library is that the requested object does not exist --- non-conforming
//!   shapes, or an output whose strides map two coordinates onto one cell ---
//!   and it is reported at view construction, before any arithmetic is named.
//! - Impose a ceiling. There is no maximum `k`, no maximum magnitude, no shape
//!   restriction, and no alignment requirement. The accumulator's width is a
//!   compile-time function of the element type, sized against the largest `k`
//!   the machine can address, so overflow is unreachable rather than guarded.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```
//! use uor_matmul::prelude::*;
//!
//! let a = [1i8, 2, 3, 4];
//! let b = [5i8, 6, 7, 8];
//! let mut c = [0i32; 4];
//!
//! let av = MatView::row_major(as_alphabet_full(&a), 2, 2).unwrap();
//! let bv = MatView::row_major(as_alphabet_full(&b), 2, 2).unwrap();
//! let cv = MatViewMut::row_major(&mut c, 2, 2).unwrap();
//!
//! // The one fallible step: does this product exist?
//! let mut t = Triple::new(av, bv, cv).unwrap();
//!
//! // The operation itself cannot fail, so it returns `()`.
//! gemm(&mut t, &Linear::OVERWRITE, GemmOptions::default(), &mut Scratch::none());
//! assert_eq!(c, [19, 22, 43, 50]);
//! ```
//!
//! # Non-goals
//!
//! See `README.md`, which states N1--N5 normatively. In brief: this library
//! does not reproduce another library's float rounding (it computes the
//! correctly-rounded value of the exact sum instead), contains no proof
//! development (the formalization is upstream and cited), makes no quality
//! claim about any codebook, does not aim to beat `matrixmultiply` on f32
//! throughput, and has no second method for any case however hard.
