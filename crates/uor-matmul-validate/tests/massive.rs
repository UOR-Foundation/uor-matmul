//! `CT-06`, `CG-08`: super-massive input.

//! Two different kinds of claim, kept apart on purpose.
//!
//! `CT-06` is `build`: a product whose operands are past the last level of
//! cache, whose depth is past every lane's capacity, and whose extents are past
//! every block, is **exact** --- and exact on every traversal the offer admits,
//! because at this size the driver's choices all change and none of them may
//! change a byte. That is asserted.
//!
//! `CG-08` is `open`: how fast it is. Reported per pass, never asserted. What a
//! per-pass report shows that a single figure cannot is whether the throughput is
//! *sustained*: a driver that thrashes, or that grows a working set as it goes,
//! reads slower on the second pass than the first.
//!
//! The sizes are chosen against the machine, not against the library: the
//! library has no size it stops working at, which is the point, and a test that
//! could only run on one machine would be measuring the machine.
