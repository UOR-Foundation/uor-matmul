//! External validation (§3.3-oracles, §10).
//!
//! This crate is dev and CI infrastructure. It is never a dependency of a
//! shipped crate, it may use `std` and `alloc`, and every oracle lives behind a
//! feature so that a validation run declares which outside witnesses it called.
//!
//! # What agreement means here (§3.4)
//!
//! **Integer oracles: bit-identical everywhere, including past their own
//! ceiling.** Reduction modulo `2^w` is a ring homomorphism, so reducing the
//! exact sum once at the end equals reducing at every step.
//! [`EncodeMode::Wrapping`] into a `w`-bit output therefore reproduces a
//! classical wrapping accumulator's bytes exactly, at every depth, including
//! depths where that accumulator has wrapped many times. There is no region
//! where an integer oracle and this library are permitted to differ, and
//! `CX-01..04` asserts byte equality over the whole corpus with **no
//! exemption**.
//!
//! A caller who wants the mathematical value rather than the wrapped one asks
//! for [`EncodeMode::Saturating`] or reads the accumulator directly. Both
//! answers come from one accumulation, which is the practical payoff of holding
//! the exact value.
//!
//! **Float oracles: agreement is not expected and deviation is the
//! measurement.** A classical `f32` GEMM computes an order-dependent
//! approximation; we compute the correctly-rounded value of the exact sum.
//! Where they differ the harness records [`Agreement::OracleInexact`] with the
//! deviation in ulps. That status never fails the gate and always appears in
//! the report.
//!
//! The inversion is the point: we hold the exact value, so the oracle's
//! deviation is measurable, and "how far off is this library at k = 4096"
//! becomes a number we publish rather than a difference we explain away.
//!
//! # A note on the crate oracles and overflow
//!
//! `ndarray` and `nalgebra` accumulate `i32` in an `i32`, so under a
//! debug-assertions build they *panic* rather than wrap once the sum leaves
//! `i32`. That is a property of those crates, not of the claim: the claim is
//! about bytes, and bytes are what a wrapping accumulator produces.
//! [`reference_wrapping_i32`] is therefore the oracle for the deep cases --- an
//! independently written classical accumulator that wraps explicitly --- and
//! the crates corroborate it over every case where they are defined.
